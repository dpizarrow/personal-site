# 🚀 My Personal Site

This is the repository for my personal site. I am using this site to show my skills, experience, and projects. I am also using this site to learn about web development and to experiment with new technologies. This site is a work in progress and I will be updating it regularly.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Build tool for a more modern web development workflow.

- **React + TypeScript**: Frontend framework and language. TypeScript is used to catch errors early and help with code quality.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.

## 🌐 Deployment

This site is deployed using Vercel, a quick and easy way to deploy web applications.
